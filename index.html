							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>
						<p>&emsp; I am an MSc Robotics student at the University of New South Wales.
							Over the past three years, I have participated in research projects, particularly working
							on the development related to computer vision and artificial intelligence. 
							<br />
							&emsp; After I earned my bachelor's degree in Power Mechanical Engineering at National 
							Tsing Hua University, I worked as a firmware engineer at PEGATRON Corporation. I participated 
							in the UEFI development and devoted myself to problem-solving and boosting product performance.
							<br />
							&emsp; I worked on the research project <i>CHARM: Companion Healthcare Aid Robot Manager</i> with 
							<a href="https://www.ntueeacl.com/25351235662594525480-advisor.html" target="_blank">Prof. Li-Chen Fu</a>
							at National Taiwan University from May 2021. I designed a user behaviour recognition system to
							detect abnormal behaviour of the elderly and reduce the risk of falls.
							The work has been awarded the 2021 National Innovation Award in Academic Research.
							<br />
							&emsp; In February 2022, I joined the Institute of Information Science at Academia Sinica. 
							In the <i>AI-Automated Training System for Figure Skating</i> project, I worked on the 
							automation of video alignment with 
							<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SzcLXlkAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Lun-Wei Ku</a>
							. I developed the video alignment function with a self-supervised learning method 
							to visualize the motion comparison between coach and learner.
							<br />
							&emsp; From these experiences, I have developed a passion for not only providing engineering
							solutions to various real-world problems but also being a contributor to novel robotics technologies.</p>
